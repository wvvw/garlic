0.0.4.3
First release - a single threaded search
0.0.4.4
Added multithreading
0.0.4.5
Fixed the spinner to cycle from 64 to 1
Renamed some variables
Added an ini file
Cleaned out leftovers from prior trials
Added logs subfolder
Added elapsed time indicator
Added a Settings dialog
0.0.4.6
Fixed bug where private_key was being saved as a blank file.
0.0.4.7
Changed from initializing SHA1 context everytime to having a copy of the
context to restore resulting in a modest speed increase. First move
toward Shallot.
0.0.4.8
Now hashing only the exponent part of the digest most of the time with
an even larger increase in speed. Second move toward Shallot.
0.0.4.9
Changed from hashing the exponent part of the DER most of the time to not
hashing the DER at all but rather a homemade exponent array equivalent to
it. This resulted in a major speed boost due to constant DER encoding no
longer needed. Found and fixed Shallot's bad key bug in the process.
Added version number to title bar. Now fully Shallot speedy and no bad
keys! This version runs 524% faster the the original Garlic.
0.0.5.0
Reverse encoding of search pattern into SHA1 style bits prior to the
search removing the need to base32 convert each trial. This yields a
further 10% increase in speed bringing it to 575% faster than the
original Garlic.
0.0.5.1
Moved a couple lines of code in the worker thread to prevent an unlikely
bug from occuring.
